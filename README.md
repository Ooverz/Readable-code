The Mission
Imagine: during your internship, you get handed an existing project to maintain.
You try to read into the project, but there's no readme 😱, you see variables like $a or $dontChangeThis and the last developer with project knowledge just left.
You wouldn't wish that to anyone, would you? Now, let's see what we can do to prevent this from happening with a focus on readability!
For projects with a longer lifespan, focusing on this is always a good idea.
Whatever bugs you spot or changing requirements you'll need to meet, it will allow you to make modifications as easily as possible.
